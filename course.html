    <dt>Cognitive Psychology</dt>
    <dd>This branch of psychology focuses on studying mental processes such as perception, memory, reasoning, decision-making, problem-solving, and language comprehension. Cognitive psychologists explore how people acquire, process, store, and retrieve information. They investigate mental abilities and processes that contribute to learning, problem-solving strategies, and decision-making mechanisms.</dd>
    </dt> <br>
    <dt>Behavioral Psychology</dt>
    <dd>Also known as behaviorism, this field of psychology emphasizes observable behaviors and the environmental factors that influence them. Behavioral psychologists study how behaviors are learned, reinforced, and modified through interactions with the environment. They often use techniques such as conditioning (both classical and operant conditioning) to understand and modify behavior. Behavioral psychology has applications in areas such as education, therapy, and behavioral interventions.</dd>
    <dt>Abnormal Psychology</dt> <br>
    <dd>This area of psychology deals with the study of psychological disorders and atypical patterns of behavior, emotion, and thought. Abnormal psychologists investigate the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders (like depression and bipolar disorder), psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia), personality disorders, and substance use disorders. They work to understand the factors contributing to mental illness and develop effective interventions for individuals experiencing psychological distress.
    </dd> <br>
    <dt>Social Psychology</dt>
    <dd> Social psychology focuses on how individuals' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by social interactions, groups, and cultural contexts. Social psychologists study topics such as social influence, group dynamics, attitudes, prejudice, conformity, obedience, interpersonal relationships, and the impact of social norms on behavior. They examine social perception, communication, cooperation, aggression, altruism, and the psychological processes underlying social behaviors. Social psychology has applications in fields such as marketing, organizational behavior, conflict resolution, and community psychology.</dd>
